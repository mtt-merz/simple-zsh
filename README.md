This repo maintains a zsh configuration that customizes the shell's behavior and appearance. It sets up the prompt, enables version control system (VCS) information, configures history and completion, and defines aliases.

Here's a brief breakdown:

1. **Prompt setup**: Sets the prompt to display the current directory, and enables prompt substitution to display VCS information.

2. **VCS information**: Enables VCS information display, formats the message, and sets up styles for different VCS states (e.g., merge, rebase).

3. **History and completion**: Configures history to ignore duplicates, shares history between sessions, and sets up completion with various styles and options.

4. **Keybindings and editor**: Sets emacs keybindings and allows using emacs even if the EDITOR variable is set to vi.

5. **Aliases**: Defines aliases.

6. **Autosuggestions**: Sources the zsh-autosuggestions plugin and sets the strategy to use both history and completion for suggestions.

Overall, this configuration aims to enhance the zsh user experience with a customized prompt, VCS information, and improved completion and history management.
